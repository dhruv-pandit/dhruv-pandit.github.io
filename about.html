                    I am an MSc student in Lisbon studying Econometrics and Data Forecasting. My educational background includes a BSc in Natural Sciences with a focus on Mathematics.
                    
                    During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern at a global automotive corporation as an Operations Analyst for their Country Head division in one of the biggest Asian markets. This experience gave me valuable insights into the real-world application of mathematical models, particularly logistics and supply chain optimization processes.
                    
                    Outside of academics and work, I have a passion for travel. In fact, I facilitated some of my travels during my undergraduate studies by playing Gaelic Football and competing in tournaments throughout cities in the Benelux region.
                    
                    Aside from that, I also enjoy cooking and creating video content as a hobby. My interest in all things data has led me to delve deeper into the world of econometrics and forecasting, especially in regards to using data for practical applications.
